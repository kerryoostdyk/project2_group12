# ETL Mini Project

In this mini-project, we extracted, transformed, and loaded data from two Excel files.
We used Python's Pandas library to create dataframes from the extracted data. After creating the dataframes, we saved them as four CSV files to optimize storage.

In part 2 of the project, we designed a database schema using QuickDBD and implemented it in pgAdmin.
We then imported the CSV files into PostgreSQL and performed several queries to analyze the dataset's categories.

In part 4, we used SQLAlchemy to load data from pgAdmin into Python.
With the data loaded, we wrote queries in Python and created visualizations using Matplotlib to present insights from the dataset. Finally, we consolidated everything into a comprehensive project write-up.
